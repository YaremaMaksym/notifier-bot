# Notifier bot
This project is a web service that subscribes to a webhook and sends a message via a telegram bot when a request is received.\
The webhook my service is subscribed to is on: https://bereal.devin.fun/ by [Devin Baeten](https://github.com/devinbaeten)


I decided to do this project because my BeReal app wasn't sending me notifications(got streek of 17 lates) even when I was using my phone. \
And now I always get notified, even when I'm working at a computer and phone isn't near.


The channel where my bot sends messages can be found here: https://t.me/BeReal_Alarm \
**Currently bot sends messages only for the Europe region**
